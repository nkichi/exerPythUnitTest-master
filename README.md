# Python Unit Test Tutorial

Note: We have completed most of our assignments in Jupyter Notebooks. However, unit testing isn't something you should be doing in Jupyter Notebooks. When you go to the video tutorial, you'll notice the presenter starts with a script called calc.py. You'll need to do this assignment in VSCode (or an editor of your choice) and create the .py file(s) shown by the presenter. (calc.py & test_calc.py) You'll need to have both files in the same folder.

## Summary of steps to complete

- [ ] Fork this repository so you have your own copy to work on.
- [ ] Clone the repository on your local machine. 
- [ ] Run the code shown in this video.
- [ ] Push your updated file to your GitHub repository.

## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
* This can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Follow along with this tutorial

* Complete the tutorial at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI
* In the last 5 minutes the presenter has you add some code working with schedules. You don't need to do that part. Specifically it says to add code to import requests and import schedule. Stop there. Don't do that part.
  
  
## Push your updated file to your GitHub repository

* This can be done in VSCode.
  * In VSCode click on the Source Control button.
  * You should see the files that had changes. (Mine has the original file which shows an M next to it and a new file which says checkpoint in the name. You really only need to push the original file, but if you push both it shouldn't hurt anything.)
  * Hover over the changed file. Click the + sign to stage the change.
  * Enter a commit message in the message field and click the checkmark to commit the change.
  * Click on the 3 dots for more actions and select Sync. This will push the updated file to your GitHub repository.
  * Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.
